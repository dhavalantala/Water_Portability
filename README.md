water-potability
==============================

Clean and safe drinking water is essential to human health, yet billions of people globally face challenges in accessing potable water. This project presents an intelligent, automated system for predicting water potability using machine learning, empowered by modern MLOps tools such as DVC, MLflow, DAGsHub, and FastAPI. The goal is to create a scalable, reproducible, and deployable pipeline that can be integrated into water quality monitoring systems used by governments, NGOs, and smart city infrastructure.
